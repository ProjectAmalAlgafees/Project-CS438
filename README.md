In this project, First, the player will enter the login page, if he has an account, he will type the username and password, if he does not have an account, he will go to the sign-up page.

In the game we have the main character Naruto and we have two values which are score and points. Naruto will run towards the front, and in front of him will be the characters Sasuke, Pain and Ramen food. Naruto must not collide with the character pain, when he collides with him, his points will decrease. Conversely, when Naruto collides with Sasuke and the food Ramen, it will increase the points and score. When the points reach 50, Naruto and Sasuke characters will transform and evolve, and this will be the Evolution of Naruto. This game is designed for anyone who enjoys playing games and loves Naruto.

## **3. Dynamic Components :**
[index (naruto – pain -sasuke – ramen -wallpaper)]


## **4. Business Logic** 
We have five columns in Database.( id -user\_id - user\_name -password – date – Score).

The id has type bigint, length 20, auto increment and Primary key, the user\_id have type bigint  and length 20 , the user\_id have type bigint  and length 20, the user\_name have type varchar and length 100 , the password have type varchar and length 100, the date have type timestamp and default value current timestamp and the Score have type int , length 11, accepts the value null and default value is Null.

When the user registers, the registration HTML form saves the data and sends it via the post method, and then sends it via query SQL and saves it in Database. When the user logs in, the HTML form takes the entered value and compares it to the values stored in the database using query Select. 

To be able to update the database and save the new score of each player, an SQL query was used. We used the “Update” SQL query to change the score of each player. An UPDATE query is used to change an existing row or rows in the database. Then we used “set” to choose which column to change, the SET clause specifies the columns to update and the new values for the columns. Lastly “where” was used to choose which player’s score to change, The WHERE clause is used to filter records. It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition. This is the SQL query that was used:

"UPDATE users SET score = '$score' WHERE user\_name = '$user\_id[user\_name]'";
